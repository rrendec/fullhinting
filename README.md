# fullhinting

This is a public wiki dedicated to font full hinting support in Linux.
The Git repository is hosted on GitHub and is used to track changes to
the wiki pages. Eventually, the wiki will be hosted on a dedicated
domain, if it gains enough traction. In the meantime, it can be viewed
on GitHub, using the built-in Markdown renderer, by going to the
[main page](index.md).
