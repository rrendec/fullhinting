# Font full-hinting Support in Linux

The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting)
summarizes it very well:

> Font hinting (also known as instructing) is the use of mathematical
> instructions to adjust the display of an outline font so that it lines
> up with a rasterized grid. At low screen resolutions, hinting is
> critical for producing clear, legible text.
